        <h2>May Fine Woodworking</h2>

        <p>
          In April of 2017, I received a call from Eric May. Eric is an amazing
          custom cabinetmaker, and his business, May Fine Woodworking, was in
          need of a new website. His site from 2012 through Wix.com was no
          longer adequate. I told him that I would be glad to help. I didn’t
          know it at the time, but this project turned into a complete redesign
          of the visual brand identity for May Fine Woodworking.
        </p>

        <h3>Business Needs &amp; Goals for the Website</h3>
        <p>
          I met with Eric to learn more about his business and to find out
          exactly what the needs were for his website. I learned that most of
          his business came through word of mouth, and that has been
          surprisingly effective for him. He told me that he prides himself on
          telling the truth, doing quality work, and being on time. Such a
          striking combination of qualities is not to be taken for granted.
          Highlighting my client's values and showcasing his beautiful handmade
          products became my goal for his website.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/MFW-old-home-page.jpg"
            alt="screenshot of the OLD mayfinewoodworking.com home page"
          />
          <figcaption>
            The old MFW website was in dire need of an update.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>
          We identified May Fine Woodworking's target audience as interior
          designers, realtors, homeowners, and also builders. They would want to
          see “pictures, lots of pictures,” as Eric put it. Unfortunately, he
          was not happy with the quality of his current photos. They had been
          taken with an old camera phone in less than ideal lighting almost
          immediately after the jobs were finished. This meant that the shelves,
          cabinets, and the rooms in which the photos were taken were empty.
          Much like a home needs to be staged for showing by a realtor, pictures
          of finished woodwork have more appeal when set in the context of a
          home with real household objects. Eric asked whether I knew any
          photographers, and as a matter of fact I did. Me!
        </p>

        <p>
          Another of my Mr. May's admirable characteristics is that he keeps in
          touch with most of his clients, many of whom live in this area. We
          arranged to meet with a few of them, so I could take photographs for
          the website. In addition, Eric showed me his garage which he had
          converted into a really cool wood workshop. I decided that pictures of
          my client working in the shop would make excellent background images
          and banners for his new, renovated website.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <a
            href="img/MFW-home-screenshot-FULL.jpg"
            data-lightbox="may-fine-1"
            data-title="May Fine Woodworking home page"
            ><img
              src="img/mfw-home-thumb.jpg"
              alt="May Fine Woodworking home page"
          /></a>
          <figcaption>
            My goal was to showcase Eric's values and his beautiful handmade
            products.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Organizing the Website</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of having one page for testimonials and another page with
          pictures of the cabinetry, we decided to have separate pages for each
          project. This way the pages can be labeled with the homeowners’ names,
          and their testimonials can be displayed along with the pictures of the
          items of woodwork in each home. The endorsements are effective and
          seem believable because they are displayed alongside of pictures of
          the work to which they are referring. I organized the Project pages
          together in a dropdown menu that appears when site visitors hover over
          or tap on “Projects” in the main navigation. This architecture allows
          for new projects to be added to the website by simply creating a new
          project page and adding it to the drop down menu.
        </p>

            data-title="May Fine Woodworking full project page"

              src="img/mfw-ashley-thumb.jpg"
              alt="May Fine Woodworking Ashley Kitchen page"
          /></a>
          <figcaption>
            Pictures and the corresponding testimonials are showcased together
            as projects.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Logo Design</h3>
        <p>
          May Fine Woodworking's old logo fit well with the old site, but since
          we were updating the look of their web presence, it was time to update
          the logo as well. I was happy to tackle the design of a logo along
          with constructing the website and doing the photography. The new
          design is reminiscent of the old, but with a much more contemporary
          and balanced look. The improvements include the use of brighter shades
          of green and gold, a much fuller and more lively maple tree emblem,
          and an updated choice of fonts. Together these changes make for a
          much-improved visual presence.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="img/MFW-old-vs-new-logos.png"
            alt="may fine woodworking old vs. new logo"
          />
          <figcaption>
            A new emblem, brighter colors, and updated font choices make for a
            much more inviting logo design.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          By using the same green and gold hues and the same font families
          throughout the website and in the logo design, I was able to bring a
          sense of unity to the brand identity of May Fine Woodworking. This
          coordination was accomplished by accessing Squarespace’s built-in
          Typekit integration. The font families used are Sofia and Freight.
        </p>

        <h3>Switching Platforms</h3>
        <p>
          During my initial meeting with my client, I suggested that he switch
          his site from Wix.com to Squarespace, and he was more than happy to do
          so. With Squarespace’s fantastic browser-based site building tools, I
          was able efficiently to put together a very professional looking
          website with a contemporary responsive design. Adding additional
          projects and content and making changes to the site in the future will
          also be streamlined thanks to the Squarespace platform. Another
          benefit is the ability to transfer ownership quickly once the design
          is approved and payment is received.
        </p>

        <p>
          My thanks go out to Eric for bringing me this wonderful opportunity to
          create both a showcase for his amazing handcrafted cabinets and a
          visual identity for his brand.
