# David Y. Soards Personal Website

This is the version control of my personal website located at https://davidysoards.com
It was created as part of my front-end development project for **Code Louisville.**

It uses **CSS Grid** extensively and is therefore a complete wreck on IE11 or below, but I am OK with that.
There is also, at the time of writing this, an issue in Microsoft Edge (ONLY) with my youtube lightbox.

The animations at the top of the pages were done using **GSAP** JavaScript and CSS.
SVGs were created in Adobe Illustrator and cleaned up using SVGOMG.

The Contact form is functional and uses files and code snippets from http://reusableforms.com/
The icons in the placeholders are emojis written directly into the html ðŸ˜€

This project was my first time using **SASS** and really enjoyed it.
